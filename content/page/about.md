# About

I am a Software Engineer with a passion for Open Source. Most of my interests lie in various topics related to
monitoring and automation - from SCADA systems, through home automation, CI/CD system, and ending on monitoring IT
infrastructure with prometheus. Right now I turn my hobby into job by working on OpenShift monitoring stack at Red Hat.

In free time I ride bikes in mountains (which is quite complicated living in Berlin :) ) or take pictures.
